1-You have html with span tag "selectable-space" or "selectable-word" and data-word-index=number and i have range from starting and ending of data-word-index you need to iterate and where found wrap with <replace> tag that chunk and store in varible (wrap the entire range-matching content (not individual elements) into a single <replace> tag)
2- now apply regex and check span tag with class "selectable-space" or "selectable-word" remove that only tags not its content inside and return this in a variable

oping = 5
closing = 5
<replace>
<>
</>
</replace>
